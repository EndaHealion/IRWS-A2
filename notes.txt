had to update pom.xml & packages names due to maven compilation errors.

I moved the project to Java 8, because I was having difficulties getting maven to
work with Java 21. I will move the project back to Java 21 soon.

The resources folder has been moved out of src/main/resources because maven was
taking too long to compile with it in that directory. I think this is because
it had to copy over all 2 GB of data each time it needed to compile. Having
it in resources/ stops this slow compile time.

I added a Makefile for the following commands:
 - make clean  -> mvn clean
 - make build  -> mvn install
 - make run    -> runs the compiled jar file with built-in dependencies
 - make        -> which runs "clean", "build" and then "run"
